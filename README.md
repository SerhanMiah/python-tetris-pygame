# Python Project - Tetris Pygame
#### Description
## Project Overview
During a 7-day project, I utilized my knowledge of Python and Pygame to develop a version of the popular game Tetris. The game includes a movable player with functions that enable rotation and sideways movement of objects, as well as the ability to speed up the downward movement. Through this project, I was able to apply my programming skills to create an engaging and functional game that showcases the potential of Python and Pygame in game development.
